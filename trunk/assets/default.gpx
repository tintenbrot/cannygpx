I decided to create sports mania because sports are my life. These caches are located at sports complex's, arenas,sports stores and fitness centers. There is parking where the cache is just located. Please do me a favour, and leave any helpful comments indicating comments and or suggestions either if the coordinates were helpful. That would be greatly appreciated. There is a surprise for the FTF!!! I hope you enjoy my sports mania series. :) Please bring your own writing utensil.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A quick look around to make sure we were clear, and then a team inspection of the site. Eagle Eyes quickly spotted the cache. We’ve seen these containers before, but I still had to read the instructions to get the thing open!

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The closest legit parking spots all had signs saying that they were for restaurant patrons only. Anyone else would be ticketed and/or towed. I almost parked there, but a staff member in the restaurant was paying too much attention. I decided to drive around back and park there for a few minutes. We headed off into the woods and the GPS had us zigzagging around a bit. When it hit zero, I began to search piles of sticks for a regular-size cache. Eagle Eyes, who had read the cache description, headed a few metres over to another site and found the micro almost right away. Neat setup! We signed the logbook in the last remaining spot, put the cache back in its place and hurried back to the car.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TFTC&lt;br /&gt;SL @ 4:40 P.M.&lt;br /&gt;2nd of 6 today; #8,906&lt;br /&gt;GordEtob &amp; DLC Eagle Eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This entry was edited by GordEtob on Saturday, 19 January 2013 at 17:12:37 UTC.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I don't know if it was my phone/gps or what but for me the coordinates were off by alot... probably my phone... never works. This cache is very creative by the way it was placed in the tree. I spotted this one first. Found with candeegurrl and Lays-chips at 3:12 pm on a nice winter day that felt alot like a spring day. Great day for a geocaching adventure. 2nd of 11 today. As we were putting the cache back, we noticed some people entering the forest and it looked like they werew getting ready to fight someone, so we quickly evacuated the area. Tough neighbourhood. But thanks for your contribution to our adventure!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completion will involve a bike ride (or hike) of around 15 Km. You will be crossing a few streets, and all are either low traffic residential, well controlled with lights, or you will be near a controlled intersection. There are a lot of instructions, so read them at least once before getting on the road.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The statements below are of two forms, Ix and Qx&lt;br /&gt;Ix are instructions to be completed in the order given to navigate a route. &lt;br /&gt;‘Qx’ statements are the 10 questions that require answering. &lt;br /&gt;Step one: follow these instructions:&lt;br /&gt;I1: Park at co-ordinates given for this cache.&lt;br /&gt;I2: Go to the South to find the trail, and then follow it westward.&lt;br /&gt;I3: At the street, jog left 50M , before crossing street, and continuing on trail&lt;br /&gt;Q1: What is the date on the dedication plaque for “Heasly Park” &lt;br /&gt;(hint: you'll have to make a temporary side trip over a metal bridge)&lt;br /&gt;I4: continue down trail&lt;br /&gt;Q2: Find a sign on the side of the trail, regarding something of the “Laurel Creek Citizens Committee”. How many letters are there in the heading (acronym of CCRP).&lt;br /&gt;I5 continue down trail&lt;br /&gt;Q3: What is the address for the school?&lt;br /&gt;I6: Follow trail through the schoolyard&lt;br /&gt;I7: When you get to the street, do not cross it, but follow it to the west. Do not leave this street (but it will leave you).&lt;br /&gt;I8: The next street you must cross, which can be busy, will bring you ‘off roading’ for over a Km. &lt;br /&gt;I9: Follow a lakeshore for a short while, then up the hill to the stone house.&lt;br /&gt;Q4: What is the heritage date of the Brubacher house&lt;br /&gt;I10: Follow the roadway at a bearing of 74 degrees, thru the round about, only turning right, at the final T intersection.&lt;br /&gt;I11 Soon, the trail will cross a street, and it can be a busy one. Consider using the nearby traffic lights. &lt;br /&gt;I12: Follow the trail, until you come to a park. Carefully cross the road, and then the tracks, and go to the map.&lt;br /&gt;The next 5 questions are in regards to features here and in the park, determine your own route&lt;br /&gt;Q5. How many pennies to purchase a trail guide?&lt;br /&gt;Q6 How many pots on the dock, by the Abraham Erb Grist Mill? (Pots have been removed, F=8)&lt;br /&gt;Q7: How many globe light poles are on the Silver Lake boardwalk?&lt;br /&gt;Q8: When was the first school built in Waterloo? (450M at 130° from the map)&lt;br /&gt;Q9: When was the band shell built? (410M at 225° from the map) &lt;br /&gt;I13: After answering questions 5 thru 9, begin to retrace your steps from the park, back toward your car. &lt;br /&gt;I14: On your return path, watch for four consecutive poles, topped with lights that might be described as ‘UFO shaped'. The light fixtures change, to ‘black boxes’, just as the trail leads where you have not been. Follow, and count, the ‘black box’ light fixtures.&lt;br /&gt;Q10: How many ‘black box’ light fixtures? &lt;br /&gt;Step two: do these calculations.&lt;br /&gt;Where:&lt;br /&gt;A = ‘date for Heasly Park’&lt;br /&gt;B = ‘number of letters in heading’&lt;br /&gt;C = ‘school address’&lt;br /&gt;D =’Heritage Landmark date’&lt;br /&gt;E = ‘pennies for a trail guide’ &lt;br /&gt;F = ‘number of Pots’&lt;br /&gt;G = ‘Number of globe lights’&lt;br /&gt;H = ‘year of school house’&lt;br /&gt;I = ‘year of band shell’&lt;br /&gt;J = ‘number of black box lights’ &lt;br /&gt;As a verification that you have answered the questions correctly&lt;br /&gt;A + B + C + D + E + F + G + H + I + J= 8554 &lt;br /&gt;Calculate: &lt;br /&gt;N = (24500 + A + B + C + D + E)/1000&lt;br /&gt;W = (28932 + F + G + H + I + J)/1000 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is at N43° N’ W80° W’</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I tried this one once before about 6 months ago but failed miserably. I couldn't find either of the first two questions and had trouble with number 10. After I got home I found out that my third answer was also incorrect. That being said, it was pretty difficult to get accurate coordinates from the amount of answers that I had. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, however, it occurred to me that with the math involved and the checksum I would actually be able to get the final coordinates with only half the answers. Laur-El and I got in the car and headed off to Waterloo park to give it a try. We got four of the five needed answers but still had trouble with number 10 so we just kind of guessed since that particular answers would have been small enough that it wouldn't make that much of a difference. So, with only four answers in hand we thought that we had enough information to get the final coords. Got to GZ and after a couple minutes of searching, Laur-El came up with the find. It was kind of an unusual way to get this cache done but it worked! Had fun doing this one tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for bringing us to all these different places and thanks for the cache!&lt;br /&gt;TN LN SL&lt;br /&gt;# 1146</groundspeak:text>

We used the information that we already had to plug into the formulas and get the coordinates that we needed, although we did spend a lot of time in and around Waterloo park, enjoying the weather.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow. So this has been sitting in the back of my mind as a to-do at some point... today I decided to give it a go. Having just recovered from a day of extreme sick-nursing, I felt well enough and energetic enough to take on this one today.&lt;br /&gt;Weather stayed relatively cool and cloudy (compared to the rest of the week), but crazy humid. Loaded with water, I set out... hastily. I failed to refresh myself with previous logs. I ended up not locating the info for the first 2 questions, and incorrectly answering #3. The rest was fairly straight forward, except the last question for which I noted a couple of options...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the math, and of course it didn't add up. I did a little google-fu for question #1 and came up with an answer I believed correct, then checked past logs - to find out about the other school. Not the first other school, but the second other school. And of course, coming back around to the start and heading to the proper school, I located question #2. So, that gave me certainty on all but 2 questions (1 and 10), but with the checksum almost spot on, I wasn't too worried - GZ would be a matter meters off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I headed to GZ, checked a couple of likely spots, and came up with the cache. Woohoo! Unfound in over a year, and it was still in excellent condition (not even a damp logbook). The short bushwhack was simple, but skeeters weren't the problem - spider webs were; gah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, heading back out, I lost my sunglasses to some twigs.&lt;br /&gt;Realizing not too far away, I zoomed back and retraced my steps. I came across a few poker chips, as well as an old rusty shovel, and other muggle trash in the area, but thankfully spotted the glasses, right where I had a web to the face the first time. heh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my experience in summation: I couldn't location the plaque for Question 1; you do need to pass two schools before finding Questions 2 and 3; Question 10 is unclear when to stop counting... but, by then the checksum shouldn't be too far off anyway. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, this was a wonderful bike trip, and I think the travelbike put on at least another 20km just for this - at least (but that was with a lot of backtracking and retracing :).&lt;br /&gt;TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;[Available in winter, recommended at night, available 24-7, parking available, bikes allowed, park and grab, dogs allowed]&lt;br /&gt;CKMS-FM was a Student run University Radio Station that broadcasted on 100.3 FM. The station boasted programming from students, professors and the community in all forms of talk and music radio. Last year, CKMS-FM was de-funded by the Federation of Students. They have changed their name to SOUND-FM (still on 100.3 FM) and completely overhauled their programming to reach a broader audience.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This Cache is in memory of the old station as it was. I used to be a programmer there, dealing with Political Talk and World Music on Thursdays, back when I was an Undergraduate Student. As much as I like the new sound of SOUND-FM, I will never forget the honesty, integrity, and love surrounding the community that was CKMS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're interested in finding out more about the station, you can look at (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CKMS-FM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;visit link&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the day, stealth may be required. This areas is a main trail for muggle students heading to and from the University of Waterloo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sandwich sized container covered in black tape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: DO NOT GO DOWN TO THE TRAIN TRACKS. This cache is not on railway property, do NOT go down the hill towards the tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

We signed in then we all went for an awesome stir fry dinner. Great night.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the fun evening .... and .... TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Made a different error this time but after looking over our calculations we found it. A great multi that got us learning about local history. It would have been great to see what this was like in the 50's. Thanx for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found! Nice multi... The final is a well-hidden micro. Reading the description carefully will give you a clue about where (not) to look. Previous finders mentioned there were in fact two caches hidden within 1.5m of each other. We found only one, though we looked carefully 1.5m all around it for the second one. The one we found had many signatures on the log paper. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;About the CC series: CC stands for Couch Cache, and it's a series of puzzle caches requiring your brains instead of your body. They're meant to keep you busy during those yucky, rainy, stormy, cold, windy, snowy days, limiting the time you actually need to spend outside. The actual caches are relatively unspectacular micro hides. Solving the puzzle will always directly give you the required cache coordinates.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Paula, Sue and Daisy are mathematical geniuses. They can do any number of calculations in their head instantly. One day, they're given the task of figuring out two numbers. Those two numbers are in the range between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and they're whole numbers (no decimal numbers). Both numbers can be the same too.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Paula is told the &lt;b&gt;product&lt;/b&gt; of both numbers (one number multiplied with the other), Sue is told the &lt;b&gt;sum&lt;/b&gt; of both numbers and Daisy is told the &lt;b&gt;difference&lt;/b&gt; between the two numbers (one number substracted from the other). However, they're not allowed to tell those numbers to each other.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Then, the following conversation ensues:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Paula:&lt;/b&gt; I don't know the two numbers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sue:&lt;/b&gt; You don't need to tell me that, I've known that already.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Paula:&lt;/b&gt; Ah, in that case, I know the numbers now.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sue:&lt;/b&gt; Ok, I know the numbers now too.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Daisy:&lt;/b&gt; I still don't know the numbers. I can guess one number, which is likely to be one of the two numbers, but I don't know for sure.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Paula:&lt;/b&gt; I know which number you're thinking of, but this one is wrong. It's not one of the two numbers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Daisy:&lt;/b&gt; Ah, then I know the numbers now too.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; And that's it! &lt;img src= "http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_big.gif" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Believe it or not, it's actually possible to figure out the two numbers. There's several different approaches to solving this, so I cannot give any hints, as one way may be easier for some people but harder for others, and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Write the two numbers as 4 digits (add leading zeroes if necessary) and call the smaller one ABCD and the larger one EFGH. (Example: if the smaller number was 345, A would be 0, B would be 3, C would be 4 and D would be 5.)&lt;br /&gt; N = G*G*G + B*D + C*E*F + (C+A)*G + G&lt;br /&gt; W = C*C*D*H + (B+D)*(E+G) + D - H&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Cache is at: N 43° 28.N' W 80° 32.W'&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You can check your answer on the &lt;a href= "http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=f4c9138131ab25938bb6564bdcebcd1c&amp;action=check&amp;wp=47433152353334&amp;name=54686520496d706f737369626c652050757a7a6c65202d204343202332" target="_blank"&gt;Geochecker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Good luck!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Congratulations to the first finders:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;FTF: &lt;a href= "http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=f96ccc26-2a0f-40a9-9b1a-9595f5f05f73"&gt; Westacular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &amp; &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href= "http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=e5e686e7-73d2-4da7-92da-22ec99cede08"&gt; geocite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;2TF: &lt;a href= "http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=4bb127e4-fcec-4c97-a248-9c717b9dfd48"&gt; gg7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;3TF: &lt;a href= "http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=11d92336-c1b9-42ee-965f-ef7e3eda9c58"&gt; Zorkmid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Almost impossible, but fascinating puzzle; needed a little help to get started and finally came up with an answer this week. Visiting UW this morning, we detoured to look for it. We were a little worried with the previous DNF, but the cache turned out to be in the first place we looked, or more accurately, the first place we stuck our hand. Thanks for the cache and the mind-numbing puzzle.</groundspeak:text>

RubberRabbit is the puzzling expert in our family, so I chose this 5 star for her late last night. I figured she would work on it during our drive in the morning, but she had it solved easily before bed time. She is amazing, and we will be doing more of your CC series on our next visit.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;font color="#999999"&gt;About the CC series: CC stands for Couch Cache, and it's a series of puzzle caches requiring your brains instead of your body. They're meant to keep you busy during those yucky, rainy, stormy, cold, windy, snowy days, limiting the time you actually need to spend outside. The actual caches are relatively unspectacular micro hides. Solving the puzzle will always directly give you the required cache coordinates.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Ever dreamt of winning the lottery? Well, here's your chance!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You have just invented a device which allows you to retrieve pieces of information from the future. Howver, it is still a beta version, so you can only use it to get information about a week ahead of time, and only a few small bits of information per week.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Since you always wanted to be rich, you instruct the device to get you the lottery numbers for the next drawing of the 6/49 lottery. Unfortunately 6 numbers at the same time is too much information for the machine, and it just spits out an error.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Being a smart cookie, you try and ask the device for the &lt;b&gt;sum&lt;/b&gt; of the 6 lottery numbers. The machine starts rattling, and voila - spits out a piece of paper with a number on it. Looking at the number, you start to realize your mistake: There's got to be thousands of possible number combinations that yield this particular sum!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Luckily the machine is also quite smart and feels your despair. It starts working again and spits out some more information: It tells you that if you figure out exactly how many possible number combinations there are (from 6 out of 49 numbers) to yield this particular sum, and then multiply this number with the sum on the paper, it will yield a new number of around one million, and you will also get the same number if you multiply all 6 lottery numbers with each other.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After that, the machine went silent.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Now you need to figure out those 6 numbers! Rest assured that this is enough information to find a single set of 6 winning numbers for the lottery.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; How to find the cache: Take the 6 numbers you got and call them A, B, C, D, E and F, in ascending order (that is, the smallest number will be A, and so on). Now some simple maths:&lt;br /&gt; N = (C * F) + B&lt;br /&gt; W = (D * F) - (A * B) + 1&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Cache is at: N 43° 28.N' W 80° 32.W'&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You can check your answer on the &lt;a href= "http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=1f7412188dda74babf59c16f34d59c20&amp;action=check&amp;wp=47433152353042&amp;name=57696e20746865204c6f747465727921202d204343202331" target="_blank"&gt;Geochecker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Please re-hide the cache carefully the same way as you found it. At times the area is highly muggled, so be careful!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Good luck!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Congratulations to the first finders:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;FTF: &lt;a href= "http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=e5e686e7-73d2-4da7-92da-22ec99cede08"&gt; geocite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;2TF: &lt;a href= "http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=11d92336-c1b9-42ee-965f-ef7e3eda9c58"&gt; Zorkmid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;3TF: &lt;a href= "http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=0aeb2e01-997d-4ea6-b5b4-a328a1178ddc"&gt; Sargents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was #4 of 8 while caching with Rain_Beauxs tonight in KW. We had our eyes set on this one, however, when we were driving past the trail, we decided against it as it seemed like a long hike in the dark. We circled around, and eventually found parking 130m from the cache! Once we were at GZ, we found the cache after a few minutes, as the hide was good. Cool swing near the cache as well. I would have loved to have played for a bit, but it was getting freezing cold at this point! SL, TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Got a few very helpful hints (thanks johnske) that got me to a point where I thought I could ubercache it. After getting to GZ, Laur-El and I started searching around but couldn't seem to find anything. After about 10 minutes or so I finally spotted the cache on the ground. Replaced it back where it belonged. That was actually a cool little hiding spot. I liked the hint/instructions for retrieval. Anyways, about 10 minutes after finding the cache I realized what I needed to do to actually solve the puzzle. Why didn't I think of that before?

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow! What a long, long, LONG adventure this was. It is safe to say this one took a year from beginning to end. With the title of the cache it isn't hard to figure out what you are dealing with, but that is where the simplicity ends. With this type of puzzle there are many ways to hide data and I checked out most of them. With no success I would put the puzzle aside to try again later. This happened almost every month for a year. Then I decided to finally reach out for some help and Tim from geocite gave me that nudge needed to start sniffing in the right direction. I researched the topic and fully understood what had to be done but I didn't have the knowledge or the means to complete the task. The last coding I have done was in Mac Turing back in university "CS100" and we were doing rudimentary coding at best. So I had to find someone a lot smarter than me for some help. In my job I deal with system designers, application developers, and integrators so I approached one of them and explained what had to be done. He was more than happy to help and already knew what he had to do. I then sat down with him and he showed me the whole process. I proved my code writing incompetency when I asked him about the program he was using and I called it "C hashtag". Apparently C# is pronounced "C sharp". I blame Twitter. After less than 30 minutes he showed me what we had. I told him I had to do a bit more research as I wasn't sure what to do next. After another week of looking I was still no where. I went back to my helper but unfortunately he was enjoying a 2 week vacation. Once he was back we met and I told him some information from Ted's log and it was a light bulb went on in his head. We were back using C hashtag &lt;img src="/images/icons/icon_smile_tongue.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt; and again he walked me through the process and in less than 10 minutes I was looking at a set of coordinates. There is no way I would have been able to solve this on my own and I don't think many people without some very specialized skills would be able to solve this. Even though I had help, I did learn a lot about the process and it was nice to be a part of it and see it first hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the grab tonight on the nightly walk with the geopooch and it couldn't have been a better night, comfortable and a slight breeze. When I got close to GZ I soon realized that I had been here before scouting the area for a possible multi hide. One of the waypoints I took at the time was actually only 10 meters away! Glad I didn't go through with the set up or I would have wasted my time. No swampy mud today but a bit soft under foot so I had to walk carefully. It was a quick find because when I got close I found a colourful shiny pencil lying on top of the mud. Looks like the last group forgot to put the pencil back in the container. Container is in great shape and everything is bone dry inside. I signed the log, placed the pencil back in, and placed back. Task completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks intrepidca for the puzzle and thanks to all those who helped me complete this task. It was an adventure that outlasted all others. This one will always stand out as the cache that gave me the most trouble.....so far. &lt;img src="/images/icons/icon_smile_big.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt;</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After a trip to Detroit for the NAMES show we were passing right by Waterloo and I wanted to try to finally find this cache since it had been replaced. Thanks to a couple of DNFs earlier in the day we were running late and yet again I was going to have to make a quick grab and dash in the dark. We also had to be in Newmarket by 11 to pick up our dog from the doggie hotel, so the pressure was really on to be quick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my rubber boots in the trunk, but almost left them there to save time. It's been an uncommonly dry spring, and last time I was here the ground was relatively dry despite a torrential downpour. In the end I decided to crawl in the back of the car while we were flying down the 401 and get my boots ready. It's a good thing too since it was a wet mucky hell this time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hit some construction on the way in which slowed us down even more, so we were really in a hurry. As soon as we found the trailhead I grabbed the GPSr and jogged out of the car while my wife parked. Rather than a cautions approach I headed straight for the cache trusting my boots to keep me dry, but I could feel the black ooze splashing the backs of my jeans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no cache in the first place that I looked, and then as I was navigating around an obstacle I managed to drop my Oregon into the muck. Normally not a problem, but the rubber cover over the power button had just ripped the day before, so I was a bit worried about water. Fortunately no harm done other than a filthy screen, and a few seconds later I found the cache and all worries about my hardware evaporated. &lt;img src="/images/icons/icon_smile.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I signed the log very quickly and practically jogged back to the car. I lost the trail once in the dark and then was soon changing my shoes on the side of the road and then driving like mad down the 401. We were only 15 minutes late picking the dog up, and I finally logged a find on this cache!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for creating a unique and fun puzzle and thanks for not hiding it in a guardrail &lt;img src="/images/icons/icon_smile.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt;.

RB and I were in the area a while back, and I remember making the walk for this one and then realizing it was probably missing. I saw that it has been replaced and today was the day to grab it, since we were in the area. We hop, and skipped, and jumped our way to GZ, avoiding all of the wet spots. Just as I was about to make a giant leap over a huge puddle, TF shouted that he had found it. Phew! This would be a terrible area to be in, after a hot summer rain! TNLNSL, TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

However, I DNF'd the cache. Well anyways, I came back today to give it another try. Still had a difficult time getting to GZ without getting a soaker but luckily a lot of the area was frozen so I had a little more solid ground to work with. My gps was going all over the place so it took me a minute or two but I eventually spotted the container and had the log signed soon after. Glad to finally get this one off the to-do list.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">It seems the hiding place may have collapsed on the original cache -- I'm not sure if it's there or not. If it is there it would be completely buried. I have replaced the container with a new one at the same coordinates but the hide isn't quite as good -- hopefully it lasts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy caching!</groundspeak:text>

These caches are located at sports complex's, arenas and sports stores. There is parking where the cache is just located. Please do me a favour, and leave any helpful comments indicating comments and or suggestions either if the coordinates were helpful. That would be greatly appreciated. There is a surprise for the FTF!!! I hope you enjoy my spors mania series. :) Please bring your own writing utensil. If you put any trading items in cache, please relate the item to the theme which is sports! HAVE FUN!</groundspeak:long_description>

That being said, the TomTom GPS we were using "snapped" our location to the nearest road so we didn't have a great idea of where to look. Looking around the building was mostly garbage which quickly detracted us. I've since downloaded a proper geocaching app for my Android phone, so you can probably chock this non-find up to newbieness.</groundspeak:text>

Finally we had our chance! I thought I knew where the cache was, so I dashed over to have a look. No – that couldn’t be it – it wouldn’t budge. Eagle Eyes came over and decided to have a go himself. He gave it a good shove, and VOILA: there was the cache. I guess I’d better head into the gym and have a workout! &lt;img src="/images/icons/icon_smile_blush.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TFTC&lt;br /&gt;SL @ 6:20 P.M.&lt;br /&gt;5th of 5 today; #8,878&lt;br /&gt;GordEtob &amp; DLC Eagle Eyes</groundspeak:text>

I can't vouch for high coordinate accuracy in here, but I did my best. :)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Note that there are posted signs for the existence of poison ivy in the area during warmer months. Please be careful as you bushwhack and dress appropriately for the season!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I have a thing for puzzle caches.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We headed along the path from the parking lot and soon determined that we were on the wrong side of the creek. But there was a handy bridge just ahead, so we made our way to that. Then we found the convenient path into the forest. All the fresh snow made for a picturesque scene as we walked along. Then we realized that we would have to plow through that snow to get to the cache area! We went down the little hill and carefully wove our way towards the cache. I stopped to let the GPS settle a bit and point to ground zero. I looked up for a second, and discovered that I was looking right at the cache!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TFTC&lt;br /&gt;TNLNSL @ 5:00 P.M.&lt;br /&gt;4th of 5 today; #8,877&lt;br /&gt;GordEtob &amp; DLC Eagle Eyes</groundspeak:text>

A relatively easy find, the difficulty comes from being stealthy. And as the name suggests, Waterloo's most permenant residents, the geese, are out in force, so snap a picture or two, but don't get too close. A nice place to walk, but watch your parking. It's pretty heavily monitored. This is at the front of campus, and probably walkable from the campus plaza to save on parking.</groundspeak:short_description>

We headed over to the area we checked last time, and then I immediately headed north about 8 metres or so. We knew the co-ordinates were too far to the south from reading past logs, so we began our search there. Within a minute, I spotted the cache, even further north. It had been left so that it was easy to see from a distance. Almost a SHOE-in! &lt;img src="/images/icons/icon_smile_wink.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt; We signed the logbook and rehid the cache a little better.

We zeroed out at a likely spot, but couldn't find the cache under all that snow. We expanded our search, but it got dark very quickly. We had our pocket flashlights, but Eagle Eyes' light gave out after a few minutes and my flashlight's batteries began to fade. Then Eagle Eyes tripped on a hidden obstacle and went crashing down. The snow helped cushion the fall a bit. We decided to throw in the towel for today and will have to come back and try again, the next time we're in Waterloo.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And I see by past logs that the co-ords are a bit off, so we'll remember to use Dr.Strange's co-ords if we run into difficulty again: N 43° 27.971 80° 32.384</groundspeak:text>

This is indeed an odd tree. Those Simpsons fans out there should get the title of the cache right away, but once you see it you will realize what I mean! Count the number of "blocks" you see. Don't over think it, just the big ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the North, take the number you have come up with and subtract 7. Now subtract that number from the North coordinates posted.&lt;br /&gt;For the West, take the number you have come up with and multiply it by 8 and add 26. Subtract that total from the West coordinates posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final area can be full of muggles lurking around at different times of the day and year. Please use stealth when necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARKING:&lt;br /&gt;You will find lots of pay parking around, so if you want to pay, please be sure you do. Note that parking tickets here do indeed show up when you pay your renewal! There are side streets that have parking from 6pm to 8am. Once such place is listed below. The nearest free parking during the day is likely at Waterloo Park.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Interesting tree! I am trying to get 15 multis for a challenge cache. I didn't notice all of the DNF's prior to going to the final. My GZ looked very promising, although I couldn't find anything except earwigs. I checked many hiding spots, but ended up wasting my time and $4 parking fee. If this isn't there, maybe it could be disabled.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After getting stage one today I started wondering where I might be able to find stage two. I quickly realized that I had already found stage two a long time ago and never took note of the clue. Fortunately, I was just able to use a little bit of logic to calculate the final coordinates without revisiting the other cache. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I parked on a nearby street and made the short walk in to GZ. Ended up finding a stump with several small toys resembling geoswag. Assuming the cache had been muggled, I was about to leave the area and go home until I read the hint. The spot where I had found the toys didn't really match the hint so I decided to keep looking for a little longer. After another minute or so I ended up finding the real cache not too far away. I didn't think of it at the time but in hindsight I probably should have removed the other little toys from the stump. Either way, the cache was found and is dry and in good condition. Had fun completing this series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for showing me this area and thanks for the cache!&lt;br /&gt;TN LN SL&lt;br /&gt;# 1110</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">All I can say is that is one crazy puzzle. I'd started this in the spring and then put it aside. Picked it up again this fall and made tremendous strides. Not realizing I had already done the hard part, when I asked the CO for some help he told me to drop it!??? It turns out I was practically sitting on top of the last pieces and just needed a push to extract them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, getting the cache was easy. Brought the kids with me and they probably would have climbed the whole thing if I hadn't stopped them (everything was still wet from the rain).</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We were caching up in K-W today, gradually making our way in this cache's direction. When hikerT suggested a cache sorta near this one, I requested that we search out this one first before continuing on with the list she'd made up for our trek. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From previous logs, I kinda knew what I was up against once we got to GZ. Kinda. When at GZ and we eventually spotted the container, I wasn't too sure I'd be able to retrieve it. I'm not the skinniest person in the world, so I had my doubts about the ability of that tree to keep me up there. Got to a certain point and then it became gut-check time. Couldn't reach it from where I was and figured I needed another rung or two more to get signed in. At this time, I really began to hear my terrestrial mammal instincts and just wanted to get back down, but I pressed onwards and managed to be able to reach the container to get signed in. I was very happy to be back on terra firma after quite the adrenaline rush. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Not sure how to summarize this headache but I'll try....1 month, 1 MacBook, 2 system designers, 10 pitchers of beer (not all at once), many late nights (because of said beer), 2 or 3 dead ends, and 1 exuberant round of high fives when the solution was found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I realized what retrieving this cache entailed I had to wait for some family ground support or at least someone who could call the ambulance. When we got to the GZ I knew where to look but not exactly "where" to look. It took my 3 yr old daughter 10 seconds to find it. I have no idea how but she did. So up I went. Signed the log in the tree but had to wait until I was on terra firma before feeling that this cache was finally over. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have done some hard puzzles before but this has been the most difficult thus far. Thanks to my helpers for their insight and patience and thanks to the fact that they work for beer. And lastly thanks for the CO for a very challenging puzzle. Pass the Tylenol.</groundspeak:text>

I did find a few little things to get me started but I'm not sure if I ever would have been able to complete the whole thing. Also, I was never given any coordinates or any hints towards the actual cache location. I did, however, find the cache using a different method: brute force. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had enough information from the cache page to nail down the cache's location within about 200m so yesterday i gave it a shot. Found GZ within about ten minutes and decided to come back today so I could get some help from Laur-El to retrieve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laur-el played the monkey on this cache and had the log in hand in no time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun time finding this one.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for bringing us here and TFTC!!</groundspeak:text>

But unlike many other BINGO challenges, the FINAL isn't at the Bogus Posted Coordiates. For that, you must use the WheriGo Cartridge found at the 'Related Web Page' link to find the FINAL cache, to log your Bingo Success.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/log/a952058e-7bd9-41ee-9a81-8bf91030e6c8.jpg" alt="WheriBinGo" /&gt; &lt;p style="color:red;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Rules:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to LOG a FIND, you must find five (5) Wherigos which form a consecutive line; either horizontally, diagonally or vertically on the Bingo card. Qualifying finds must be listed in your log for this challenge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finds logged anytime in the past or future qualify for this challenge; but I'd appreciate it if you would log them on the WheriGo.com website as well; so I can track them there. There is no need to use the UnLock feature; simply acknowledge that you played the game there (the baax FTF example works for me).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The "PLAY ANYWHERE Wildcards" can be selected from any 'Play Anywhere' Cartridges published on the WheriGo.com website; however each WheriGo can only be used once on the Bingo card. Also, the WheriGo website does not require you to find the physical caches, which are occasionally part of 'Play Anywhere' WheriGos; particularly helpful since some are quite far away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the many 'wildcard' Play Anywhere candidates include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cinema 2: Numbers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cinema: The Red Carpet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Geocaching Trivia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Battleship&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Whack-A-Lackey Part 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Bowling for Cache&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Or Any of the Others you chose, and identify in our log&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;To any of the CO's of the Guest WheriGos or the 'Play Anywhere' cartridges. I will allow you a 'square claim' on your WheriGo; since you normally can't do your own caches and you've provided something for me to use in my BINGO (Sorry -- Only 'One Owner Square' /CO on the card).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Finally, please note that Victoria Crossing has been 'disabled' until Spring because of a City Park Improvement Project. See its logs for a temporary work around&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you have claimed a 'BINGO', you may want to continue to fill in the grid. Each time you complete another BINGO line, post a note and you may qualify for a spot on the list below, as it is updated, until full.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p style="font-family:Verdana;color:#254117;font-size:24px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;First to Find&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;baax and Laur-El     12/23/2011 6:54am&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p style="font-family:Verdana;color:#5B4DE1;font-size:14px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;First to BINGO the Rows:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Row 1 = rucache     12/28/2011 8:30pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Row 2 = K'J'     01/01/2012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Row 3 = K'J' 04/08/2012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Row 4 = K'J' 02/08/2012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Row 5 = baax and Laur-El     12/23/2011 6:54am&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;First to BINGO the Columns:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;B = K'J'     12/23/2011&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;I = K'J' 03/14/2011&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;N = K'J' 04/08/2012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;G = rucache     12/29/2011 2:37pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;O = ElectroQTed     12/24/2011&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;First to BINGO the Diagonals:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;B1 to O5 = thebruce0     02/06/2012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;B5 to O1 = thebruce0 02/15/2012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="font-family:Verdana;color:#254117;font-size:24px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1st to Complete the Card = K'J' 04/08/2012 "&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was #2 of 3 today while in the area with tiggrrr. I've been qualified for this one for a few months now, but was in the area qualifying for another challenge. Had no problems with the cartridge, and it was very enjoyable to do it at night! At GZ, my GPS was point one day but my geosenses were pointing in another direction. That's where we found the cache. I'm giving you a fav. Qualifers below.

This was the 5th day of doing a 5/5 in a row, which will (eventually in some distant future) be used to qualify for a local challenge cache.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">did this one in the pouring rain today after i had completed the bottom row accross for the bingo. &lt;br /&gt;See pic for current card.&lt;br /&gt;Starting off this was not where i expected it to be. I got to stage 1 and could not find anything so i guessed 2 guesses got me a correct answer then off to stage two. Boy i must be blind today because i couldnt find anything there either so 4 guesses later i was off to the final. Well this was a quick grab i liked that. the rain got harder as the walk to the car seamed to take forever. The cartridge crashed 3 times on me garmin oregon but lucky i save often. I needed this 5/5 for another challenge only 4 more days till complete .Thank you for the very wet adventure</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Retruned to Kitchener for some more caches after doing the GET series. We all managed to qualify for this one after getting Lackner Woods Treasure Hunt. No problems getting to the right spot but had trouble finding the cache. Keith eventually spotted some camo tape attached to a hook on the ground, so we knew we were in the right spot. After quite a bit more searching he spotted the cache container in the falled brush. Made the tricky retrieval and cache contents were in great shape. Tape was no longer stick, so we stuck it half in the lid and screwed the lid back on and hung it about chest high in the tree. Cache is good to go again for now. Thanks for the enjoyable Challenge. I qualify with the top row and Column G.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Enjoyed a great day of caching with Keith Watson, res2100 and nickjonh. Started our day with the GET trail, then we drove, did more trails, grabbed a few drive bys as we cached towards Kitchener and our way home. Ralph found the tape over there, Keith found the cache over there, and because I was on the right side of the tree, was able to get my hand on it. Team effort all around! BINGO!!! I too qualify with the top row across the bingo card.
